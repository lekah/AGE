    "The functionality shown here can help targeting recursive queries and operations that can be described as *Update rules*. Some examples are:\n",
    " - Get all nodes that are connected (via any kind of link) to a given node.\n",
    " - If groups are defined as *adjacent* if they store the same node, get all connected groups of a certain group\n",
